        <h2>Full-time Freelancer</h2>
        <p>
          Full-time Freelancer is a short, self-published book that offers a
          concise view of the finances involved in freelancing full-time. It
          contains real financial numbers from my freelancing experience in 2010
          and 2011. I wrote it for those who are planning to go out on their own
          at some point and would like to see a real-world scenario of what that
          looks like. Itâ€™s the book I wish I had been able to read before I
          dived in to freelancing full-time.
