      <h2>Full-time Freelancer</h2>
      <p>
        Full-time Freelancer is a short, self-published book that offers a
        concise view of the finances involved in freelancing full-time. It
        contains real financial numbers from my freelancing experience in 2010
        and 2011. I wrote it for those who are planning to go out on their own
        at some point and would like to see a real-world scenario of what that
        looks like. Itâ€™s the book I wish I had been able to read before I dived
        in to freelancing full-time.
